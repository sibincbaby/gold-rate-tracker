## 🔧 Customization

### Change Gram Quantities
Want different quantities? Edit this line:
```python
GRAM_QUANTITIES = [2, 5, 8, 10]  # Default
```

#### Common Customizations:

**For Jewelry Buyers:**
```python
GRAM_QUANTITIES = [2, 5, 8, 10, 20]  # Added 20g for heavier jewelry
```

**For Investors:**
```python
GRAM_QUANTITIES = [10, 50, 100]  # Investment quantities
```

**For Chain/Bracelet Buyers:**
```python
GRAM_QUANTITIES = [3, 5, 7, 10]  # Typical chain weights
```

**Minimalist:**
```python
GRAM_QUANTITIES = [5, 10]  # Just two common quantities
```

**Comprehensive:**
```python
GRAM_QUANTITIES = [1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100]  # Full range
```

### Disable Multi-Gram Display
If you only want per-gram rate:
```python
ENABLE_MULTI_GRAM_DISPLAY = False
```

### Change Display Format
Edit the `format_multi_gram_prices()` method (around line 558) to customize:

**Add Line Breaks (Vertical Layout):**
```python
def format_multi_gram_prices(self, rate_per_gram):
    if not ENABLE_MULTI_GRAM_DISPLAY:
        return ""
    
    prices = []
    for grams in GRAM_QUANTITIES:
        total_price = rate_per_gram * grams
        prices.append(f"• {grams}g: ₹{total_price:,.0f}")
    
    return "\n".join(prices)  # Vertical instead of horizontal
```

**Add Decimal Precision:**
```python
prices.append(f"{grams}g: ₹{total_price:,.2f}")  # Shows .00
```

**Different Separator:**
```python
return " • ".join(prices)  # Bullet separator
return " / ".join(prices)  # Slash separator
```

## 🚀 Advanced: Price per Weight Category

Want to see which quantity gives best value? You could extend the feature:

```python
# Hypothetical: Show making charges impact
def format_with_making_charges(self, rate_per_gram):
    MAKING_CHARGE_PERCENT = 15  # 15% making charge
    
    prices = []
    for grams in GRAM_QUANTITIES:
        gold_cost = rate_per_gram * grams
        making_charge = gold_cost * (MAKING_CHARGE_PERCENT / 100)
        total = gold_cost + making_charge
        prices.append(f"{grams}g: ₹{total:,.0f} (MC: ₹{making_charge:,.0f})")
    
    return "\n".join(prices)
```

Would show:
```
💰 Quick Prices (with 15% making charges):
2g: ₹18,090 (MC: ₹2,360)
5g: ₹45,224 (MC: ₹5,899)
8g: ₹72,358 (MC: ₹9,438)
10g: ₹90,448 (MC: ₹11,798)
```

## 🔢 Number Formatting

The display uses Indian number format with commas:
- ₹15,730 (not ₹15730)
- ₹78,650 (not ₹78650)

This makes large numbers easier to read!

## 📱 Notification Placement

The multi-gram prices appear:
1. **After** the immediate change info
2. **Before** the yesterday comparison
3. **Before** the period context

This order provides:
- Main alert info first
- Quick prices in the middle
- Context at the end

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### How It Works:
```python
def format_multi_gram_prices(self, rate_per_gram):
    if not ENABLE_MULTI_GRAM_DISPLAY:
        return ""
    
    prices = []
    for grams in GRAM_QUANTITIES:
        total_price = rate_per_gram * grams
        prices.append(f"{grams}g: ₹{total_price:,.0f}")
    
    return " | ".join(prices)
```

**Process:**
1. Takes 1g rate (e.g., ₹7,865)
2. Multiplies by each quantity [2, 5, 8, 10]
3. Formats with commas
4. Joins with " | " separator
5. Returns formatted string

### Performance:
- **Instant**: Simple multiplication
- **No API calls**: Calculated locally
- **No delays**: Added to existing notification
