## üìà Profit/Loss Calculator

### Formula:
```
Profit = Selling Value - Buying Cost

Where:
Selling Value = (Current Rate √ó Grams) √ó (1 - Fee%)
Buying Cost = Purchase Rate √ó Grams
```

### Example:
```
Bought: 10g @ ‚Çπ7,700/g = ‚Çπ77,000
Selling @ ‚Çπ7,865/g with 2% fee

Selling Value: (‚Çπ7,865 √ó 10) √ó (1 - 0.02)
             = ‚Çπ78,650 √ó 0.98
             = ‚Çπ77,077

Profit: ‚Çπ77,077 - ‚Çπ77,000 = ‚Çπ77 ‚úÖ
ROI: (‚Çπ77 / ‚Çπ77,000) √ó 100 = 0.1%
