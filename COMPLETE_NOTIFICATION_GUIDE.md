## 🧮 Mental Math Shortcuts

### Quick Calculations Without Calculator:

**For 5g:**
- 5g = Rate × 5
- Example: ₹7,865 × 5 ≈ ₹7,850 × 5 = ₹39,250 (actual: ₹39,325)

**For 10g:**
- 10g = Rate × 10
- Example: ₹7,865 × 10 = ₹78,650 (just add a zero)

**For 8g:**
- 8g = 10g - 2g
- Example: ₹78,650 - ₹15,730 = ₹62,920

**Daily Change Impact:**
- ₹50/g increase × 10g = ₹500 more
- ₹100/g increase × 10g = ₹1,000 more
